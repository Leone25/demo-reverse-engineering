# Running

After cloning this repository just run `npm i`, `cp backend/config.example.js backend/config.js` and `npm run prod` to start the server on port 8888.
When deploying to a more permanent server you might want to build the frontend once with `npm run frontend:prod` and then start the server with `npm run backend:prod`.
